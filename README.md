# WhatsApp - Zendesk Integration

## Purpose

It is common practice for small businesses to offer customer support through WhatsApp for simpler customer issues that can be solved in a few messages. Either way, it is very common for businesses to have a WhatsApp line setup for customer queries. However, it is not efficient to keep track of multiple platforms receiving customer queries.  which is how this project came about.

## Functionality

1. **WhatsApp -> Zendesk Integration:** Automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk linked to the correct customer/organization when a WhatsApp message is sent.
2. **(Coming Soon) Real-time Conversation Updates:** Update existing tickets in real-time if the conversation continues within a certain timeframe.
3. **(Coming Soon) Zendesk -> WhatsApp Integration** Public replies in Zendesk to WhatsApp tickets are sent back to the customer via WhatsApp.
