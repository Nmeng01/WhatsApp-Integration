# WhatsApp - Zendesk Integration

## Purpose

Firstly, it is common practice for small businesses to offer customer support through WhatsApp for simpler customer issues to keep the phone lines less busy. Secondly, customer support agents may find themselves on hold with a customer for a variety of reasons, and the time spent on hold could be used to answer a quick question from another customer rather than just simply waiting. However, it is inefficient to keep track of support tickets through multiple platforms, and businesses already utilizing Zendesk would likely want to keep all their tickets in Zendesk. The project I am developing here will allow agents to seamlessly communicate via Zendesk with customers reaching out through WhatsApp.

## Functionality

1. **WhatsApp -> Zendesk Integration:** Automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk linked to the correct customer/organization when a WhatsApp message is sent.
2. **(Coming Soon) Real-time Conversation Updates:** Update existing tickets in real-time if the conversation continues within a certain timeframe.
3. **(Coming Soon) Zendesk -> WhatsApp Integration** Public replies in Zendesk to WhatsApp tickets are sent back to the customer via WhatsApp.
